# Functionality
WORK IN PROGRESS! If you experience any bugs or unintentional behavior, please [make an issue](https://github.com/iceflarexd/osu-Total-PP-Calculator/issues/new/choose)

Enter new top plays and see how much weighted PP it would give you.

(Example: If you wanted to see how many more 300pp plays you'd need to get 5000pp weighted PP)

Please note that as of version 0.1.0, there are no asynchronous tasks implemented yet so expect the program to freeze temporailiy while grabbing a user's total PP.
